# flarum-imgur-upload v3 [![Packagist](https://img.shields.io/packagist/v/botfactoryit/flarum-imgur-upload.svg)](https://packagist.org/packages/botfactoryit/flarum-imgur-upload)

**flarum-imgur-upload** is a [Flarum](https://github.com/flarum/flarum/) extension that allows posting images in Flarum posts using [Imgur](https://imgur.com/) for image hosting.

## Features
With flarum-imgur-upload you can **attach** as many images as you want while writing your post, and the extension will automatically embed the images in your post.

Opposed to [flagrow/upload](https://github.com/flagrow/upload), this extension:

- doesn't touch your database
- uses Markdown for including images
- doesn't wrap the image in a frame, nor does it crop the image
- uploads the image using only client-side code (without using server/bandwidth resources)
- allows you to stop using the extension whenever you want. Previously uploaded images will stay there forever

Compared to the extension this repository has been forked from, this extension:

- doesn't resize/change orientation of images. The raw file is uploaded to Imgur

## Install

```
composer require botfactoryit/flarum-imgur-upload
```

## Configuration
Since **flarum-imgur-upload** uses Imgur API to upload your images, you will need an Imgur Client ID. To get one simply register to the [Imgur](https://imgur.com/) website, and register an application [here](https://api.imgur.com/oauth2/addclient).
You need to choose a name for your application (e.g. My Forum), and select *OAuth 2 authorization without a callback URL*.

Once your application has been registered, your Client ID will be available [here](https://imgur.com/account/settings/apps). Simply put it in the configuration of the extension, in your admin page.

## Usage
When writing/editing a post click on the *Attach* button.
